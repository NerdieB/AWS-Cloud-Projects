Creating a user using the AWS Identity and Access management
login to the AWS management console, navigate to the 'IAM service'
click on Users > Add user 
set the username of the user > select your preferred AWS access type > set password
set permissions: this enables you to attach user permissions to certain AWS services
add tags (this is optional) > review your settings > click on 'create user'
download the .csv file of the user you created. This is very important as it contains all the details about the user.

EC2 instances are virtual machines in AWS. You can provision and connect to them via SSH, RDP, Session manager, etc.
For this project, I provisioned a Windows EC2 instance and connected to it via RDP (Remote Desktop Connection).
Steps
To launch and instance;
login to the management console > Compute > EC2
click > launch instance > select the Operatig system (in this case, a Windows server)
Name our server > select the configuration to suit you, or you can go with the default configuration
create and download your keypair > click on 'launch instance'
To connect to the instance; 
On the left side of the Compute console, click > Instances
Select the instance you want to connect to > click on 'connect'
On the new window that comes up, click on 'RDP Client'
Download the remote desktop file
Get your password using the keypair you created while provisioning the instance (click on 'browse' to locate the keypair)
click on 'decrypt password' > copy the decrypted password
click on the downloaded RDP file > connect
Use default admin credentials and the decrypted password to login
click > ok > yes > connect
